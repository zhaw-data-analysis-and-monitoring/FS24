Find the average education level in the sample. What are the lowest and highest years of education? \n2. Find the average hourly wage in the sample. Does it seem high or low?  \n3. The wage data are reported in 1976 dollars. Using the Economic Report of the President (2011 or later), obtain and report the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the years 1976 and 2010.  \n4. Use the CPI values from 3) to find the average hourly wage in 2010 dollars. Now does the average hourly wage seem reasonable?  \n5. How many women are in the sample?

How many women are in the sample, and how many report smoking during pregnancy?  \n2. What is the average number of cigarettes smoked per day?

Use the indicator variable `train` to determine the fraction of men receiving job training.  \n2. The variable `re78` is earnings from 1978, measured in thousands of 1982 dollars. Find the averages of `re78` for the sample of men receiving job training and the sample not receiving job training. Is the difference economically large?  \n3. The variable `unem78` is an indicator of whether a man is unemployed or not in 1978. What fraction of the men who received job training are unemployed? What about for men who did not receive job training? Comment on the difference.  \n4. From questions 2 and 3, does it appear that the job training program was effective?

The variable children refers to the number of living children. The variable electric is a binary indicator equal to one if the woman’s home has electricity, and zero if not.  \n\n1. Find the smallest and largest values of `children` in the sample. What is the average of `children`?  \n2. What percentage of women have electricity in the home?  \n3. Compute the average of `children` for those without electricity and do the same for those with electricity. Comment on what you find.  \n4. From question 3), can you infer that having electricity “causes” women to have fewer children?

The variable `prate` is the percentage of eligible workers with an active account; this is the variable we would like to explain. The measure of generosity is the plan match rate, `mrate`. This variable gives the average amount the firm contributes to each worker’s plan for each \\$1 contribution by the worker. For example, if `mrate` = 0.50, then a \\$1 contribution by the worker is matched by a 50¢ contribution by the firm.\n\n1. Find the average participation rate and the average match rate in the sample of plans.\n2. Now, estimate the simple regression equation \n$\\widehat{prate} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}mrate,$ \nand report the results along with the sample size and R-squared.\n3. Interpret the intercept in your equation. Interpret the coefficient on `mrate.`\n4. Find the predicted `prate` when `mrate` = 3.5. Is this a reasonable prediction?\nExplain what is happening here.\n5. How much of the variation in `prate` is explained by `mrate`? Is this a lot in your\nopinion?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary('wooldridge')\ndata('k401k')\n?k401k\n\n#1)\nmean(k401k$prate)\nmean(k401k$mrate)\n\n#2)\nLinMod <- lm(prate ~ mrate, data=k401k)\nsummary(LinMod)\n\n#3)\n#Intercept is 83.0755\n#if mrate increase by 1% then prate increases by 5.86%\n\n#4)\n#No\n\n#5)\n#R-squared=0.075.

The variable salary is annual compensation, in thousands of dollars, and ceoten is prior number of years as company CEO.\n\n1. Find the average salary and the average tenure in the sample.\n2. How many CEOs are in their first year as CEO (that is, `ceoten` = 0)? What is the\nlongest tenure as a CEO?\n3. Estimate the simple regression model\n$log(salary) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1ceoten + u,$\nand report your results in the usual form.

We could use either variable as the dependent variable. For concreteness, estimate the model $sleep = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1totwrk + u,$ where `sleep` is minutes spent sleeping at night per week and `totwrk` is total minutes worked during the week.\n\n1. Report your results in equation form along with the number of observations and R-squared. What does the intercept in this equation mean?\n2. If `totwrk` increases by 2 hours, by how much is `sleep` estimated to fall? Do you find this to be a large effect?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary('wooldridge')\ndata('sleep75')\n?sleep75\n\n#1)\nLinMod <- lm(sleep ~ totwrk, data=sleep75)\nsummary(LinMod)\n\n#2)\n#120*0.15075=18.09 minutes\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nFor the population of firms in the chemical industry, let `rd` denote annual expenditures on research and development, and let `sales` denote annual sales (both are in millions of dollars).\n\n1. Write down a model (not an estimated equation) that implies a constant elasticity between rd and sales. Which parameter is the elasticity?\n2. Now, estimate the model using the data in RDCHEM.RAW. Write out the estimated equation in the usual form. What is the estimated elasticity of rd with respect to sales? Explain in words what this elasticity means.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary('wooldridge')\ndata('rdchem')\n?rdchem\n\n#1) Constant elasticity -> log ~ log regression, the elasticity is the slope parameter\n\n#2)\nLinMod <- lm(log(rd) ~ log(sales), data=rdchem)\nsummary(LinMod)\n#when sales increase by 1%, R&D increase by 1.08%\n\n```\n:::\n",
