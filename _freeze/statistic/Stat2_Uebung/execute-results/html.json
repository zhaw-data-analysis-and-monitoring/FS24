One measure of infant health is birth weight; a birth weight that is too low can put an infant at risk for contracting various illnesses. Since factors other than cigarette smoking that affect birth weight are likely to be correlated with smoking, we should take those factors into account. For example, higher income generally results in access to better prenatal care, as well as better nutrition forthe mother. An equation that recognizes this is $bwght = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1cigs + \\beta_2 faminc + u.$\n\n1. What is the most likely sign for `\\beta_2`?\n2. Do you think `cigs` and `faminc` are likely to be correlated? Explain why the correlation\nmight be positive or negative.\n3. Now, estimate the equation with and without faminc, using the data in BWGHT.RAW. Report the results in equation form, including the sample size and R-squared. Discuss your results, focusing on whether adding `faminc` substantially changes the estimated effect of `cigs` on `bwght`.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nUse the data in HPRICE1.RAW to estimate the model $price = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1sqrft + \\beta_2bdrms + u,$ where `price` is the house price measured in thousands of dollars.\n\n1. Write out the results in equation form.\n2. What is the estimated increase in price for a house with one more bedroom, holding square footage constant?\n3. What is the estimated increase in price for a house with an additional bedroom that is 140 square feet in size? Compare this to your answer in question 2.\n4. What percentage of the variation in price is explained by square footage and number of bedrooms?\n5. The first house in the sample has $sqrft = 2.438$ and $bdrms = 4$. Find the predicted selling price for this house from the OLS regression line.\n6. The actual selling price of the first house in the sample was \\$300,000 (so `price` = 300). Find the residual for this house. Does it suggest that the buyer underpaid or overpaid for the house?",
