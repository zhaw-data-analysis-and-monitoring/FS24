## Preparation {#sec-rauman-preparation}

As part of Rauman 1 - 3, we will need some R packages. We recommend installing them *before* the first lesson. Similar to the preparation exercise [in Prepro1](#sec-prepro-preparation) you can use the code below to automatically install all packages that have not yet been installed.

```{r}
#| eval: false

ipak <- function(pkg) {
  new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
  if (length(new.pkg)) {
    install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
  }
}

packages <- c(
  "sf", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "spatstat.geom", "spatstat.explore",
  "gstat", "tidyr", "terra", "tmap"
)

ipak(packages)
```

You can also download the data for the exercises on [Moodle]().
