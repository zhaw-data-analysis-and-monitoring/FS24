## Preparation {#sec-infovis-preparation}

As part of InfoVis 1 - 2, we will need several R packages. We recommend installing these *before* the first lesson. Individual packages are typically installed as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "lubridate", "readr", "scales", "tidyr"))
```

However, this will re-install packages that you might have already installed. The package `pacman` helps with this: it checks if the package is already installed before downloading it:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# install packman (this is necessary only once)
install.packages("pacman")
```


```{r}
pacman::p_install(
  "dplyr", "ggplot2", "lubridate", "readr", "scales", "tidyr",
  force = FALSE,
  character.only = TRUE
  )

```

You can download the datasets for the exercises from Moodle:
