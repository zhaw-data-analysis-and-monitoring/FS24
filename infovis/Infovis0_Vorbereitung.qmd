## Preparation {#sec-infovis-preparation}

As part of InfoVis 1 - 2, we will need several R packages. We recommend installing these *before* the first lesson. Similar to the preparation section in the pre-processing tutorial, you can use the following code to automatically install any packages that are not already installed.

```{r}
#| eval: false

ipak <- function(pkg) {
  new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
  if (length(new.pkg)) {
    install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
  }
}

packages <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "lubridate", "readr", "scales", "tidyr")

ipak(packages)
```

You can download the datasets for the exercises from Moodle:
